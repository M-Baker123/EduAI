requirements/dependencies:
In addition to the requirements.txt libraries we need the models themselves. The OCR models are EasyOCR for the AI-based engine and Tesseract for the rule-based engine. EasyOCR will download automatically on the first run, but Tesseract ,unfortunately, isn't portable so you will have to download it from https://sourceforge.net/projects/tesseract-ocr.mirror/ and then point the program to the tesseract.exe
As for AI-based translation, summarization, and quizzes, you will have to download them from hugging face (warning total is around 5GB)
